/**
 * Cutlyra M3 (+ M1 spike, see apps/mobile/src/spike/) — builds
 * apps/mobile/src into apps/mobile/www, the static bundle Capacitor packages
 * into both native apps (plan M3 item 2: bundled locally, never loaded from
 * a dev server or a remote URL at runtime).
 *
 * Two pages, one bundle: `index.html` (M3's product placeholder — untouched
 * by the M1 spike) and `spike.html` (the M1 spike's hidden diagnostics
 * screen). Both ship in the same www/ output and therefore the same native
 * app binary; `spike.html` is reachable only via the deep link documented in
 * docs/SPIKE-GUIDE.md, never linked from index.html.
 *
 * `wasm()`: `opencut-wasm` is wasm-bindgen's `--target bundler` output
 * (`import * as wasm from "./opencut_wasm_bg.wasm"` inside its own glue —
 * see that package's opencut_wasm.js), which is the "ESM WebAssembly
 * integration" proposal Vite does not implement natively. `vite-plugin-wasm`
 * is the standard bridge for exactly this wasm-bindgen output shape.
 * `build.target: "esnext"` (below) is what lets the transformed module keep
 * its native top-level `await` instead of Vite trying to downlevel-compile
 * it away — deliberately NOT using the companion `vite-plugin-top-level-await`
 * transform plugin: it crashed at the rendering-chunks stage against this
 * repo's resolved `@swc/core@1.16.0` ("missing field `type`", an
 * AST-version mismatch inside that plugin's own SWC round-trip), and it is
 * unnecessary anyway — this app's platform floors (iOS 17 WKWebView, Android
 * minSdk 29 System WebView, both plan §2.5) are years past every engine's
 * native top-level-await support (Safari 15/2021, Chrome 89/2021), so
 * `esnext` alone is sufficient here.
 *
 * Verified necessary directly in this repo: no prior bundler config anywhere
 * (Next.js's webpack config included) ever solved this —
 * `packages/editor-core/src/services/renderer/compositor/wasm-compositor.ts`
 * has never actually been exercised through a real bundler before the M1
 * spike (see that file's and apps/mobile/src/legacy-harness.ts's own
 * comments).
 *
 * `esbuild.jsx`/`jsxImportSource` (structural-gap fixer pass — this app now
 * mounts `@cutlyra/mobile-ui`'s real `EditorShell`, its first host outside
 * apps/web's Next.js dev route): this repo's own `src/**\/*.ts` files never
 * use JSX (see main.ts/legacy-harness.ts's plain-DOM style), but
 * `@cutlyra/mobile-ui`'s `.tsx` source ships UNCOMPILED — its package.json
 * `exports` point straight at `./src/*.tsx` — and Vite bundles that source
 * directly, the same way it already bundles `@cutlyra/editor-core`'s source
 * (see the `resolve.alias` comment above). Those files use TS's `"jsx":
 * "react-jsx"` automatic-runtime convention (no `import React` in scope —
 * see e.g. editor-shell.tsx), so this app's OWN bundler needs to agree, or
 * the emitted `jsx(...)` calls reference an import that was never added. No
 * `@vitejs/plugin-react` needed for that alone: this app has no Fast Refresh
 * requirement (it only ever runs through `vite build` into a packaged
 * Capacitor shell, never a live dev server a device points at — see the
 * `server.hostname` comment on `capacitor.config.ts`), and esbuild's own
 * `jsx`/`jsxImportSource` transform options, forwarded here, are sufficient
 * for a one-shot build.
