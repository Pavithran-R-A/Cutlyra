# Cutlyra M12/M13 — builds a SIGNED Android release APK, for direct
# distribution (GitHub Releases), via gradle.
#
# Requires four environment variables pointing at a real keystore — see
# docs/RELEASING.md for how to generate one (locally, once, outside any
# agent session) and where to store it as repo secrets. This script does
# not generate, fetch, or embed any secret material itself:
#   CUTLYRA_RELEASE_KEYSTORE           — path to the .jks/.keystore file
#   CUTLYRA_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
#   CUTLYRA_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
#   CUTLYRA_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
#
# Without those set, ../android/app/build.gradle falls back to an
# unsigned release build (see the comment at the top of that file) —
# this script still runs, it just won't produce an installable-without-
# resigning APK. .github/workflows/release.yml is the only place these
# four env vars are normally populated (from repo secrets, on a `v*` tag
# push).
