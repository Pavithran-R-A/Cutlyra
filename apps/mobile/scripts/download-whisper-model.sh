# Cutlyra M10 — build-step download of the bundled whisper.cpp GGML model.
#
# Plan M10 item 1: "Ship models in the app bundle so captions work offline
# from first launch," fetched at BUILD time, never committed to git (142MB+
# binary weights, and license-distinct from this repo's own MIT code — see
# THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES). This mirrors the exact pattern the (real,
# upstream) whisper.cpp repo itself uses for its own examples
# (`models/download-ggml-model.sh`) — same source, same URL shape — with
# two Cutlyra-specific additions: (1) it drops the file straight into BOTH
# platforms' bundle-asset locations in one invocation, since both need the
# identical weights, and (2) it verifies against a checksum this project
# captured directly (see PINNED_SHA256 below), as a MISMATCH WARNING, not
# a hard failure — Hugging Face is not a source this repo controls, and a
# legitimate re-upload of the same model is more likely than tampering, so
# treating a mismatch as fatal would just make CI flaky. A mismatch is
# printed loudly either way; nothing here silently accepts a corrupt file
# (short-read / non-2xx downloads are already `curl --fail`'d).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/download-whisper-model.sh <tiny.en|base.en> [--platform ios|android|both]
#
# Verified for real in this repo's M10 session (2026-08-17): both models
# below were downloaded from the URLs used here and independently
# transcribed a sample clip with `whisper-cli` on this machine — see
# packages/native-bridge/src/__tests__/fixtures/jfk-dtw-raw.ts for the
# base.en capture this produced.
