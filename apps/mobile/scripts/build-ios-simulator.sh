# CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO matches the top-level engineering rule for this
# project: local signing is flaky from agent sessions; real signing happens
# in CI (see ../../.github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml, which runs this exact
# sequence). This script is the same commands the M3 session ran locally,
# kept here so a future session/CI doesn't have to re-derive them.
