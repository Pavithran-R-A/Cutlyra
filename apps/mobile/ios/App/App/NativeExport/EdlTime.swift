/// The exactness argument: `CMTime(value:timescale:)` stores a rational
/// (numerator=value, denominator=timescale) internally — it does not round
/// to a float. Using `meta.ticksPerSecond` directly AS the `CMTime` timescale
/// means an EDL tick count maps to a `CMTime` with ZERO rounding error: tick
/// 1 at 120000 ticks/sec becomes exactly `CMTime(value: 1, timescale:
/// 120000)`, not an approximation of 1/120000 seconds. This is what plan
/// §2.2's "Time values crossing the EDL bridge are integer ticks + rational
/// frame rates, never float seconds" actually buys us on the AVFoundation
/// side: `CMTime` is rational-native, so the tick contract and `CMTime`'s
/// own representation line up exactly, with no lossy hop through
/// `Double` seconds anywhere in this mapper.
