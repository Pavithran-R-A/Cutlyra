/// PURE integer arithmetic, zero AVFoundation/Foundation-date dependencies

/// so this, the single most novel piece of M9 (corpus 07/10 both flag "no
/// precedent found" for this exact bridge, and plan §5 risk #4 calls the
/// hand-built transition compositor "the largest single unknown... schedule
/// it first, not last"), is unit-testable without a simulator, a real
/// video file, or even AVFoundation being linked at all.
///
/// THE DESIGN DECISION THIS FILE ENCODES (no existing precedent to copy —
/// see corpus `07-ios-webview.md` §8 "Precedent search — honest result"):
/// a transition of `durationTicks = d` placed `afterClipId = A` (immediately
/// followed by clip `B` on the main track) is realized by inserting `B`'s
/// FULL, untruncated media `d` ticks before `A`'s nominal (untruncated) end,
/// so the two overlap for exactly `d` ticks. Neither clip's OWN inserted
/// media is shortened — the overlap comes entirely from where `B` starts,
/// never from cutting frames out of `A`. This is why `insertDuration(i)`
/// below is always the clip's full nominal `durationTicks`: only
/// `insertStart` ever moves. This matches how CapCut/most consumer NLEs
/// present a transition dragged onto a cut — it "eats into" existing
/// footage on both sides, costs no extra source frames, and the total
/// exported duration shrinks by `d` per transition versus naive
/// concatenation. Downstream (non-adjacent) clips ripple left by the
/// cumulative sum of every `d` before them, so contiguity is preserved
/// everywhere a transition doesn't touch.

	/// Never let a transition consume an entire clip (a `d == duration`

	/// half of the SHORTER neighbor, minus one tick, which guarantees both
	/// neighbors keep a non-empty solo range. This clamp is a documented v1
	/// safety net, not a claim that the plan specifies this exact ratio —
	/// no source specifies one (see file header).
	/// SYNC FIX: transitions compress the main track (plan file header —
	/// each transition shortens the overall timeline by its `durationTicks`
	/// vs. naive concatenation), but text/sticker overlay clips and
	/// secondary-audio clips carry their OWN `startTicks` authored against
	/// the ORIGINAL, pre-compression EDL timeline (there is exactly one
	/// producer of this document, `buildEdl`, and it has no idea the native
	/// exporter will later compress the main track — see the plan's own
	/// note that `buildEdl` never populates `transitions[]` yet at all).
	/// Left unaddressed, any overlay/audio clip positioned AT OR AFTER a
	/// transition would drift out of sync with the (now-earlier) main-track
	/// content by exactly that transition's `durationTicks` — a real,
	/// easy-to-miss cross-track sync bug, not a hypothetical one.
	///
	/// This builds a monotonic step function mapping a NOMINAL (EDL-authored)
	/// tick to its OUTPUT (post-compression) tick: flat at `shift == 0`
	/// until the first transition's incoming clip begins, then increases by
	/// that transition's `durationTicks` at each subsequent transition
	/// boundary. `remapNominalTick` looks up the applicable shift for any
	/// given nominal tick and subtracts it.
	///
	/// Known approximation (documented, not silently wrong): only a clip's
	/// `startTicks` is remapped, not independently its `startTicks +
	/// durationTicks`. An overlay/audio clip whose span straddles a
	/// transition boundary keeps its ORIGINAL duration after its start is
	/// shifted, so it can end up to one transition's `durationTicks` too
	/// long or short at that boundary. For v1's transition durations
	/// (sub-second) this is a minor edge case; a fully exact remap would
	/// need to split such a clip at the boundary, which is out of scope
	/// here.
