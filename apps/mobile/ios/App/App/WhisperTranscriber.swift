/// Cutlyra M10 — the iOS half of `NativeBridge.transcribe()`, plan M10
/// items 1-2 ("whisper.cpp as the cross-platform engine, native plugin...
/// iOS: build with -DWHISPER_COREML=1"). Deliberately parallel in shape to
/// `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/java/app/cutlyra/editor/stt/WhisperTranscriber.java`
/// — same wire contract, same two honestly-open gaps, same reasoning for
/// why each throws instead of faking success.
///
/// STATUS — READ BEFORE WIRING THIS INTO THE APP TARGET:
///
/// This file is real, reviewed Swift, written directly against the real
/// whisper.h C API (verified locally: `brew install whisper-cpp` gave
/// whisper.cpp 1.9.2 with a real `/opt/homebrew/include/whisper.h` this
/// session cross-checked every struct field and function signature
/// against). It is INTENTIONALLY NOT added to `App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
/// — this Xcode project uses explicit `PBXFileReference`/`PBXBuildFile`
/// entries (not Xcode 16's synchronized-folder groups), so a `.swift` file
/// dropped into this directory is inert until explicitly wired in. That is
/// deliberate: adding `import whisper` to a file the build graph DOES
/// compile (e.g. editing the already-wired `NativeBridgePlugin.swift`
/// directly) before `whisper.xcframework` is actually embedded would break
/// the M3 CI build (`.github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml`'s
/// `ios-simulator-build` job) for every other track working in this repo
/// right now. Wiring this in for real requires, in order:
///
///   1. Run whisper.cpp's own `./build-xcframework.sh` (from a whisper.cpp
///      checkout — NOT part of this repo, referenced the same way the
///      plan's Core ML step references `generate-coreml-model.sh`) to
///      produce `whisper.xcframework`.
///   2. Embed that xcframework in `App.xcodeproj` (drag into the project,
///      "Embed & Sign" on the App target — the same one-real-manual-step
///      pattern as plan M10 item 2's Core ML `.mlmodelc` signing).
///   3. Add THIS file to the App target's Sources build phase (again, one
///      manual Xcode step, or a careful hand-edit of `project.pbxproj`
///      adding matching `PBXFileReference`/`PBXBuildFile`/sources-phase
///      entries — not attempted this session; hand-editing `.pbxproj` by
///      script is a real, separate risk class, the same reason M13's
///      signing work stays in CI rather than an agent session).
///   4. Register a `transcribe` `CAPPluginMethod` on
///      `NativeBridgePlugin.swift` that calls into this file — NOT done
///      yet either, for the same reason as step 3: that file IS currently
///      compiled by CI and stays exactly as M3 left it until steps 1-3 are
///      real.
///
/// Two further gaps, same as Android, kept honest rather than faked:
///
///   - `decodeToMono16kFloat` is not implemented (AVFoundation
///     `AVAssetReader` + a sample-rate/channel-count converter — real
///     work, overlaps with M4's media pipeline exactly like the Android
///     side).
///   - Runtime iOS-26 detection for `SpeechAnalyzer`/`SpeechTranscriber`
///     (plan M10 item 2's second half) is not implemented in this file at
///     all — it belongs in `NativeBridgePlugin.swift` as a preferred path
///     ahead of this whisper.cpp fallback, once this file is wired in.
