/**
 * THE cross-fade math (plan M9 risk #4 — "Media3 has no cross-clip
 * transitions... build the transition compositor FIRST, not last").
 *
 * Kept 100% framework-free (no `androidx.media3.*`, no Android types) on
 * purpose: this is the one piece of the transition compositor whose
 * correctness can be fully verified on a plain JVM without a device or
 * emulator (`TransitionAlphaMathTest`). Everything downstream of this file
 * (`CrossfadeCompositorSettings`, wired into a real Media3
 * `VideoCompositorSettings`) is a thin adapter that cannot itself be
 * unit-tested without a GL context — see that file's doc comment.
 *
 * The compositing model (matches Media3's own `OverlaySettings.alphaScale` /
 * `DefaultVideoCompositor` semantics — index 0 is the opaque "primary"
 * background, every other registered index is alpha-blended on top of it
 * with the standard `src-over` operator: `out = overlay*alpha +
 * primary*(1-alpha)`):
 *
 *   base sequence (index 0): every main-track clip, hard-cut, in order —
 *     this is the "no transitions" render and is ALWAYS fully opaque.
 *   one short overlay sequence per transition (index 1..N): just the head
 *     of the INCOMING clip, trimmed to the transition's duration, positioned
 *     (via a leading gap) so it plays exactly across the transition window,
 *     with `alphaScale` ramping 0 -> 1 linearly across that window.
 *
 * At window-start the overlay is invisible (base clip A shows through
 * untouched); at window-end alpha=1 exactly when the base sequence's clip A
 * -> clip B hard cut happens underneath, so the seam is fully covered by the
 * incoming clip B at full opacity — no visible cut, no double-exposure past
 * the window edges. This is the standard `src-over` crossfade identity,
 * expressed with primitives Media3 documents as public API (`08` §8's own
 * framing: "manually cross-fading alpha via a custom OverlayEffect/shader
 * across the transition window") rather than a hand-rolled GLSL blend pass.
