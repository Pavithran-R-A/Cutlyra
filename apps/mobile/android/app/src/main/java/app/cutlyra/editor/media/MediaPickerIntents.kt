/**
 * Cutlyra M4 item 2 (corpus 08 §6): "`WebChromeClient.onShowFileChooser()`
 * override launching `ACTION_PICK_IMAGES` (Photo Picker) with SAF fallback."
 *
 * This repo's `NativeBridge.pickMedia()` is invoked directly from JS via the
 * Capacitor plugin call (`NativeBridgePlugin.pickMedia`), not through a
 * hidden `<input type="file">` DOM element — Cutlyra's mobile UI never
 * renders a file input at all (see `NativeBridgePlugin.kt`'s doc comment).
 * That sidesteps `onShowFileChooser` entirely rather than implementing it:
 * corpus 08 §6's own conclusion is "treat file import ... as a native-app
 * responsibility from day one, not a WebView responsibility" — calling the
 * native picker directly from the bridge method IS that, one layer earlier.
 * The *mechanism* 08 §6 warns about (Photo Picker isn't wired up
 * automatically) is what this file solves either way.
