/**
 * Test 4 (plan M1 item 4): whisper.cpp `tiny` over 60s of speech on-device,
 * both platforms, reporting wall clock and word-timestamp output vs. ground
 * truth.
 *
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED in this pass — reported honestly, not faked. Bundling and
 * building whisper.cpp for iOS (XCFramework/SPM) and Android (NDK/CMake)
 * plus a real GGML `tiny` model file is substantial standalone integration
 * work belonging to plan M10 ("Local on-device captions"), which no track
 * has started as of this spike (verified: no `whisper` references anywhere
 * in the repo tree at the time this file was written). `NativeBridge.
 * transcribe()` itself already throws a typed `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` error
 * pending M10 — see `packages/native-bridge/src/capacitor-bridge.ts`.
 *
 * This function calls through that real (stubbed) bridge method rather than
 * a fake, so the harness's behavior here is genuine: it correctly detects
 * and reports "engine not bundled," which is itself the accurate M1 status
 * for this measurement today. When M10 lands a real transcribe()
 * implementation, this test starts producing real numbers with no code
 * change needed here.
