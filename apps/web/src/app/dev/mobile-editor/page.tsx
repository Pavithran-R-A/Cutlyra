/**
 * M8 dev harness — panels/toolbars/export sheet, driven by a REAL
 * `EditorCore` instance (`bootstrapDemoProject` inside `EditorShell`),
 * not mock data. Reachable at /dev/mobile-editor. Not a production route —
 * visual + interaction QA for this milestone, same status as
 * /dev/mobile-timeline (M7) and /dev/mobile-ui (M6).
 *
 * Every control in the primary toolbar / contextual toolbar / panels /
 * export sheet writes through a real `@cutlyra/editor-core` command (see
 * `packages/mobile-ui/src/editor/actions.ts`) — this page exists to prove
 * that in a real browser, not to simulate it.
 *
 * Fixer pass: M7's `TimelineView` is now mounted inside `EditorShell`
 * (fed by live `EditorCore` state, not mock data), so the correct way to
 * reach `demo-project.ts`'s four pre-inserted elements is tapping their
 * clip on the timeline below the playback bar — that calls the real
 * `editor.selection` the same way selecting a freshly-inserted element
 * does. (This comment previously described a nonexistent "inserted
 * elements' row in the Edit panel" — no such control ever existed in any
 * panel; that was a real doc/reality mismatch, not a stale note about a
 * removed feature.) Opening the Edit sheet with nothing selected now shows
 * a "select an element first" prompt instead of an empty sheet body.
