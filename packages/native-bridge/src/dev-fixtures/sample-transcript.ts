/**
 * A pre-transcribed, dev-harness-only sample — plan M10's exit criterion
 * "verify the full generate -> edit -> preview flow in the dev harness using
 * the web fallback + a pre-transcribed fixture."
 *
 * NOT a capture of real whisper.cpp DTW output (that's
 * `caption-smoothing.ts`'s own fixture, `__tests__/fixtures/jfk-dtw-raw.ts`,
 * built specifically to verify the SMOOTHING pass against real, documented
 * defects). This fixture's job is different: it's already-smoothed, clean,
 * hand-authored `TranscriptSegment[]` data — exactly the SHAPE
 * `NativeBridge.transcribe()` yields after smoothing — so the web-fallback
 * bridge can hand it to the UI and exercise generate -> edit -> preview end
 * to end in a plain browser, with zero native STT, zero network, and zero
 * ambiguity about whether a rendering bug is really a smoothing bug wearing
 * a UI costume.
 *
 * Word timings are illustrative (a plausible ~150-280ms/word reading pace),
 * not measured from any real audio — there is no real audio file backing
 * this fixture, only the sentinel `MediaHandle` below. This is a deliberate,
 * disclosed simplification: `DEV_FIXTURE_MEDIA_URI` is recognized
 * ONLY by the web-fallback bridge (see `../web-fallback.ts`), never by the
 * Capacitor bridge, and never treated as a real file anywhere else.
